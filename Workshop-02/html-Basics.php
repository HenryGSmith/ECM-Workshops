  <p class="abstract">
    The modules we outline here provide examples of what you can expect to learn on this degree course based on recent
    academic teaching. The precise modules available to you in future years may vary depending on staff availability and
    research interests, new topics of study, timetabling and student demand.

    <h2 id="ecm1400">ECM 1400: Programming</h2>
    <p>
      We use computers in almost all aspects of our daily lives and throughout science, so it is easy to take them for
      granted. However, in order that we can use computers to solve new problems and create new things, we have to be
      able to program them. This module introduces you to programming and problem solving with a computer. You will
      learn how to formulate an algorithm to solve a problem, and you will acquire the skills to write, test and debug
      programs.

    <h2 id="ecm1407">ECM 1407: Social and Professional Issues of the Information Age</h2>
    <p>
      The module aims to provide you with the tools to reflect upon your role in the interface between digital
      technologies and society and on the moral and ethical use of information and information systems. By taking this
      module, you will become aware of your legal responsibilities and rights as an IT professional and as a user of
      digital technologies. The module will cover ethical theories, computer law and professional codes of conduct, and
      will address the ways in which broader areas of law (e.g. defamation, contracts, privacy and freedom of
      information legislation) impact upon technology users and IT professionals.

    <h2 id="ecm1410">ECM 1410: Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
    <p>
      This module will introduce you to object-oriented problem-solving methods and provide you with object-oriented
      (OO) techniques for the analysis, design and implementation of solutions. We will introduce you to these concepts,
      and you will develop skills with a new programming language. By the end of this module, you will be able to apply
      these skills to design and implement small applications.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ecm1413">ECM 1413: Computers and the Internet</h2>
    <p>
      This module is designed to equip you with the foundational information you need to understand and work in business
      and technical fields requiring the use of computers and networking technologies. Computing technology has a
      diversity of applications, so this module is suitable both for computer science students and for those pursuing
      other study disciplines. On this module, you will acquire useful knowledge of computer systems, computer networks
      and information systems analysis and design.
